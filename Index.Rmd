```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
df <- read.csv(file="EarthQuakemodified.csv")

df$popup <- paste("Location:",df$place,"<br> Date:",df$Date,
      "<br>Magnitude:",df$mag,"<br>Depth:",df$depth," km")
earthquakeIcon <- makeIcon(
  iconUrl = "earthquakeImage.png",
  iconWidth = 38, iconHeight = 38,
  iconAnchorX = 22, iconAnchorY = 94
)

df %>% 
      leaflet() %>%
      addTiles() %>%
      addMarkers(icon=earthquakeIcon,popup=df$popup, clusterOptions=markerClusterOptions())
